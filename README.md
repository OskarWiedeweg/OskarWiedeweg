# Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Oskar
A passionate fullstack dev located in Germany

## Tech I work with

### Backend

#### Spring Framework
<p>
    My main expertise lies in the Spring Framework. I have used it to develop many backends for my applications, such as school management tools, small search engines, online marketplaces and more.
</p>

### Databases

#### Postgres 
<p>
    Most of the time I work with Postgres. The quick setup, proper tools and relatively small loads make it the go to option for working with clients.
</p>

#### Neo4j
<p>
    Sometimes relational databases aren't right for the job. I like to use graph databases when there are a lot of connections involved (e.g. in a recommendation system).
</p>

### Frontend

#### Svelte and SvelteKit
<p>
   I am absolutely in love with SvelteKit. It makes it so easy to develop reactive websites. A lot of it focuses on the developer experience. Plus it's fast.
